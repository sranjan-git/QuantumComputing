> Quantum Enthusiasts: Learn, Build, Deploy.

Azure Quantum Workspace
==========================
Can use in Jupyter Notebook ar in CLI.

Azure Account.

Azure Quantum Jobs
=====================
It uploads job vacancies on the portal, aferwards you can apply, then goes onto the waiting area.
Cancel state. 

Workflow of the Quantum Software Development
==============================================

Diagrammatic Representation.

Quantum cloud solutions available on Azure Quantum
=====================================================

Once we have validated that our code correctness and estimated that it is fit to run on the 
hardware, we are ready to submit our program to Azure Quantum.

Quantum computing providers: Quantinuum, IONQ, Quantum Circuits, Inc
Optimization providers: 1QBit, Microsoft QIO, Toshiba SBM.


Jupyter Notebooks Options in Azure Quantum
=============================================

Using keyboard shortcuts is the fastest way to use Azure Quantum Workspace.

We can access all shortcuts here:
Three dots > Keybinding > Shortcuts available to use.

Exploring features in Quantum Workspace
=========================================

Alerts : We can create alerts. Also, we can put up certain conditions.

Activity Graphs

Creating Quantum Workspace using CLI
=======================================
Please refer to this link for detailed explanation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/how-to-manage-quantum-workspaces-with-the-azure-cli

> We can add role assignments.

Optimization
===============
It is the process of finding the best solution to a problem
from a set of possible options, given its desired outcome
and constraints.

Quantum Inspired Optimization
===============================

Azure Quantum Optimization Techniques
========================================
Parallel Temperimng - Copies of a system are kept at a diff temperature.
Simulated Annealing - simulation method which mimics the slow cooling of a substance, to remove imperfections.
Population Annealing - 
Quantum Monte Carlo - mimics the quantum annealing method by using the quantum monte carlo simulations.
Substochastic Monte Carlo - diffusion monte carlo algo inspired by adiabatic quantum computation, it simulates the diffusion of a population of walkers in the search space, where walkers are removed or duplicated, based on how they perform, at the cost function. 
Tabu Search - neighbouring configurations, accepts versioning moves,
